                    Create a div tag with the class of “gridOne”.
                    Create two paragraph tags that respectively say “Hello World” and “My Fantastic Content”.
                    This grid should have two equally sized columns.
                    Use inline styling to turn the text of the second paragraph tag blue.-->

                    Make sure that none of the grids are nested inside each other.
                    Give this div the class of “gridTwo”.
                    Create three divs inside of gridTwo.
                    Assign them each a unique class.
                    Add a paragraph tag to each of the divs with whatever text you would like.
                    Each child div should have its own different background color.
                    Try using red, blue, and yellow.
                    This grid should have three columns.
                    The third column should be twice as large as the first two columns.
                    The background colors will help you identify if the sizes created by your grid-template-columns are correct. -->

                    Give this div the class of “gridThree”.
                    Create two child divs inside of gridThree and give them both a unique class.
                    The first child div should contain a paragraph tag and the second should contain an image of your choice.
                    This grid should have two rows.
                    The second row should be three times as large as the first.
                    Use background colors again to help make the sizes clear.
                    Give gridThree a width of 500 pixels and a height of 300 pixels. 
                    *Make sure that you give the image a width of 500 pixels and a height of 225 pixels.
                    You will also need to make sure that object-fit equals cover so that the image will not be distorted or too large for the row.-->

                    Create two child divs and give the first a unique class name and the second an ID.
                    The first div should contain a paragraph tag.
                    The second should contain two paragraph tags.
                    GridFour should have two equally sized rows.
                    Now we will deal with a nested grid.
                    Select the second child div by its ID.
                    Use CSS Grid to create another grid in that div.
                    There should be two grid columns of equal size.
                    Give gridFour a width of 500 pixels and a background color of green.-->

                    The first picture should be twice as wide as the second.
                    You will also have to resize these images so that they fit, try making each 200 pixels tall and wide.

                    GridSix should have two grid-template-columns.
                    The second column, with the paragraph, should be three times the size of the first column with the icon.
